## üìö FOUNDATION
Le dossier foundation permet de configurer l‚Äôinfrastructure en code (IaC)

# 1. Configuration de Terraform et du Provider Scaleway
Nous allons d'abord d√©finir les configurations de base pour Terraform et sp√©cifier que nous allons utiliser le provider Scaleway.

terraform {
  required_providers {
    scaleway = {
      source = "scaleway/scaleway"
      version = ">= 2.0"  # Assurez-vous de la version support√©e par Scaleway pour votre configuration
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
}

provider "scaleway" {
  project_id = var.scaleway_project_id
  region     = "fr-par"
}

# 2. Cr√©ation d'un Registre de Conteneurs
Le registre de conteneurs est l‚Äôendroit o√π seront stock√©es les images Docker.

resource "scaleway_container_registry_namespace" "registry" {
  name = "calculatrice-registry"
  description = "Registry pour les conteneurs de la calculatrice"
  project_id = var.scaleway_project_id
  region     = "fr-par"
}



# 3. Cr√©ation d'un Cluster Kubernetes
Le cluster Kubernetes sera utilis√© pour d√©ployer et g√©rer les microservices de l‚Äôapplication.

resource "scaleway_k8s_cluster" "cluster" {
  name                      = "calculatrice-cluster"
  project_id                = var.scaleway_project_id
  region                    = "fr-par"

  delete_additional_resources = false
  tags                      = ["calculatrice-cloud-native"]
}
Ajout des pools de n≈ìuds

  size        = 3
  node_type   = "DEV1-M"

  region      = "fr-par"
}

# 4. Configuration des Bases de Donn√©es (Development et Production)
Les bases de donn√©es sont n√©cessaires pour stocker les donn√©es selon les environnements (d√©veloppement et production).

  tags            = ["environment:production"]
}


# 5. Configuration des Entr√©es DNS
Pour acc√©der √† votre application via des noms de domaine, nous allons configurer les entr√©es DNS n√©cessaires.

5.1- D√©finition des variables pour le nom du mon√¥me
variable "nommonome" {
  default="anna"
 description = "Nom du monome"
  type        = string
}

5.2- Ajout des enregistrements DNS pour les Load Balancers

resource "scaleway_dns_record" "dns_prod" {
  zone = "kiowy.net"
  name = "calculatrice-${var.nombinome1}-${var.nombinome2}-polytech-dijon"
  type = "A"
  ttl  = 300
  value = scaleway_lb_ip.prod_ip.address
}

resource "scaleway_dns_record" "dns_dev" {
  zone = "kiowy.net"
  name = "calculatrice-dev-${var.nombinome1}-${var.nombinome2}-polytech-dijon"
  type = "A"
  ttl  = 300
  value = scaleway_lb_ip.dev_ip.address
}

# 6. Configuration des LoadBalancers (D√©veloppement et Production)
Les LoadBalancers seront utilis√©s pour diriger le trafic vers le cluster Kubernetes.

resource "scaleway_lb_ip" "prod_ip" {
  project_id = var.scaleway_project_id
  zone       = "fr-par-1"
}

resource "scaleway_lb_ip" "dev_ip" {
  project_id = var.scaleway_project_id
  zone       = "fr-par-1"
}

resource "scaleway_lb" "lb_prod" {
  name       = "calculatrice-lb-prod"
  project_id = var.scaleway_project_id
  zone       = "fr-par-1"
  ip_id      = scaleway_lb_ip.prod_ip.id
  type       = "lb"
}

resource "scaleway_lb" "lb_dev" {
  name       = "calculatrice-lb-dev"
  project_id = var.scaleway_project_id
  zone       = "fr-par-1"
  ip_id      = scaleway_lb_ip.dev_ip.id

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
